      <p><strong>Wearable devices are transforming healthcare.</strong> With the rise of smartwatches and fitness trackers, health monitoring is more accessible than ever. Some wearables have even been credited with saving lives during medical emergencies.</p>
      <p><strong>Diabetes is a growing concern.</strong> As global obesity rates increase, so does the prevalence of diabetes. Research shows a clear correlation between obesity and diabetes, making early detection more critical than ever.</p>
      <p><strong>Can wearable devices help track glucose changes?</strong> If continuous glucose monitors and other wearable sensors can detect patterns in blood sugar levels, they could provide early warnings and help prevent dangerous fluctuations.</p>
      <p>In this analysis, we explore real-world data from glucose monitoring devices, examining their effectiveness in tracking blood sugar variations across different health conditions.</p>

  <!-- DATA EXPLANATION & METHODOLOGY -->
  <div class="thin-text">
    <h3>Understanding the Data</h3>
    <p>
      In this analysis, we explore how various biometric signalsâ€”such as heart rate, body temperature, and movementâ€”correlate with glucose levels. 
      The goal is to determine whether wearable devices can detect meaningful glucose changes and help in early diabetes management.
    </p>
    <p><strong>What Are We Measuring?</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Glucose Value:</strong> Directly measured blood sugar levels.</li>
      <li><strong>Accelerometer (ACC):</strong> Captures movement and activity levels.</li>
      <li><strong>Blood Volume Pulse (BVP):</strong> Tracks changes in blood flow, associated with cardiovascular activity.</li>
      <li><strong>Electrodermal Activity (EDA):</strong> Measures skin conductance, which relates to sweat and nervous system activity.</li>
      <li><strong>Heart Rate (HR):</strong> Monitors beats per minute, potentially affected by glucose fluctuations.</li>
      <li><strong>Interbeat Interval (IBI):</strong> The time between heartbeats, another cardiovascular metric.</li>
      <li><strong>Skin Temperature (TEMP):</strong> Monitors body temperature variations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>What is Correlation?</strong></p>
    <p>
      Correlation measures the relationship between two variables. A positive correlation means that when glucose increases, the measured variable also increases. 
      A negative correlation means that as glucose increases, the measured variable decreases. If correlation is close to zero, there is little to no meaningful relationship.
    </p>
    <h3>Methodology</h3>
    <p>
      We analyzed biometric data collected from wearable devices and glucose monitors. Participants were divided into two groups based on their HbA1c levels:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="color: #ff6b6b;"><strong>Diabetic Group:</strong></span> Participants with HbA1c > 5.7.</li>
      <li><span style="color: #4a90e2;"><strong>Non-Diabetic Group:</strong></span> Participants with HbA1c â‰¤ 5.7.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For each participant, we computed correlation values between glucose levels and wearable measurements.
      The results are categorized into three sections:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Both Groups:</strong> Strong correlations exist in both diabetic and non-diabetic groups.</li>
      <li><strong>One Group:</strong> A correlation exists in only one group.</li>
      <li><strong>Neither:</strong> No significant correlation found.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      To help visualize the results, we plotted the correlation values across different measurements.
      The shaded gray area in the graphs represents little correlations (-0.1 to 0.1), while EVIDENCED correlations extend beyond this range.

  <!-- RESULTS INTERPRETATION -->
  <div class="thin-text">
    <h3>Interpreting the Results</h3>
    <p><strong>At a glance, we see that different biometric signals respond differently to glucose changes.</strong> Some measurements show strong correlations across all participants, while others vary based on diabetes status.</p>
    
    <h3>Breaking Down the Results</h3>
    <p><strong>Both Groups:</strong> Electrodermal Activity (EDA) and Skin Temperature show correlation with glucose levels in both diabetic and non-diabetic participants.</p>
    <p>ðŸ’¡ This suggests that <strong> might play a role in glucose fluctuations</strong> across all individuals.</p>
    
    <p><strong>One Group:</strong> Heart Rate (HR) and Accelerometer (ACC) correlate with glucose levels in diabetic participants, but not in non-diabetics.</p>
    <p>ðŸ’¡ This could mean that <strong>heart rate fluctuations and movement patterns</strong> are more affected by glucose instability in diabetics.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Neither:</strong> Interbeat Interval (IBI) and Blood Volume Pulse (BVP) show <strong>weak or no correlation</strong> with glucose levels.</p>
    <p>ðŸ’¡ These signals may not be reliable indicators of glucose change and might require further study to determine their role.</p>
    
    <p>We later break further down the groups to specific HbA1c levels among our testing data.</p>

    <h3>Exploring Individual Glucose Correlations</h3>
    <p>
      The slider allows us to explore how different <strong>HbA1c levels</strong> influence glucose correlations across various biometric signals. 
      HbA1c represents long-term blood sugar control, and by adjusting the slider, we can see how different measurementsâ€”such as heart rate, skin temperature, and movementâ€”correlate with glucose levels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some measurements may be more relevant for people with higher or lower, or a specific range of HbA1c levels.
      This visualization helps identify which wearable signals play a better role in tracking glucose variations for different groups.

    <h1>Now How Does Glucose Tracking Relate With Our Diets?</h1>
    <p>
      Now that we have covered how biometrics could help track pre diabetes, let's explore how diets played a role in this study. 
      We all know diabetes are often the result of poor eating habits and we aim to explore how exactly consuming food throughout the day would impact our glucose tracking levels.
